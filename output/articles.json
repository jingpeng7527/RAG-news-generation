While both aim to address national security concerns, they have faced significant roadblocks due to the lack of support from key stakeholders.\n\n**Amendment 3926:** This amendment, proposed by Senator Risch, seeks to impose sanctions on individuals and entities associated with the People's Republic of China (PRC). It prohibits various transactions related to national security and prohibits notifications about investments in the PRC by US persons.\n\n**Amendment 3927:** Proposed by Senator Thune, this amendment aims to limit the use of Federal law enforcement officers for crowd control and other purposes. It also prohibits the use of Federal law enforcement officers in certain sensitive situations.\n\nDespite reaching the required quorum for a vote, neither amendment has yet seen the light of day. This is likely due to the lack of support from key cosponsors, including the Senate Majority and the White House.\n\nThe context also provides limited information on the recent actions related to the bill.

            "2": "The **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** is a reconciliation bill that includes legislation submitted by **11 House committees** pursuant to the FY2025 congressional budget resolution (H Con. Res. 14). These committees were directed to submit legislation to the House Budget Committee to address deficit changes and debt limit increases. As a reconciliation bill, it is processed using expedited legislative procedures in both the House and Senate, preventing filibusters and restricting amendments. Specific committees mentioned in the bill include the **Committee on Agriculture** (Title I), but the primary focus is on the 11 House committees that contributed to its development.",
            "3": "The sponsor of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act is not mentioned in the provided context. The summary and amendments listed do not include information about the original bill's sponsor. To identify the sponsor, additional sources such as official congressional records or the bill's text would need to be consulted.",
            "5": "The provided context does not mention any hearings held on the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** or their findings. The summary focuses on the bill's provisions, its status as a reconciliation bill, and specific amendments (e.g., Amendment SA 2848 and SA 2847). No legislative hearings or associated findings are detailed in the supplied information.",
            "7": "Yes, votes occurred on amendments to the One Big Beautiful Bill Act. Specifically:  \n- **Amendment SA 2848** (to \"improve the bill\") was agreed to in the Senate by a **51-50** vote. This narrow margin suggests a **party-line vote**, as the majority party (likely Democrats, given the 51-50 split in a 100-member Senate) likely supported it.  \n- **Amendment SA 2847** (related to airport lease revenues) was **not agreed to** in a **50-50** vote, indicating **bipartisan opposition** or a tie.  \n\nHowever, the context does not specify whether the **full bill** itself passed or failed, only that amendments were considered during its legislative process. Reconciliation bills typically proceed under expedited rules, but final passage details are not provided here.",

Key developments include:  \n- **Amendment SA 2848** (to improve the bill) was agreed to by the Senate (51\u201350).  \n- **Amendment SA 2847** (related to airport lease revenues) was not agreed to (50\u201350).  \nThe bill\u2019s final passage depends on Senate approval of the amended text.",
            "6": "Yes, two amendments have been proposed on the **One Big Beautiful Bill Act** (H.R. 119).  \n\n1. **Amendment SA 2848**:  \n   - **Status**: Agreed to in the Senate (51\u201350 vote).  \n   - **Purpose**: To \"improve the bill\" (specific provisions not detailed in the context).  \n   - **Type**: Senate Amendment to the Main Text (SAMDT).  \n\n2. **Amendment SA 2847**:  \n   - **Status**: Not agreed to in the Senate (50\u201350 vote).  \n   - **Purpose**: To use revenues from lease payments from Metropolitan Washington Airports for aviation safety improvements and other purposes.  \n   - **Type**: Senate Amendment to the Main Text (SAMDT).  \n\nThe context does not specify the proposers of these amendments.
